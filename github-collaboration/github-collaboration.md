# GitHub Collaboration

### Projected Time
About 1 to 1.5 hour
- 7 minutes for video walkthrough of slides
- 14 minutes for slides
- 30-45 minutes for Independent Practice

### Prerequisite
- Git version control lesson
- Git code storage lesson
- Terminal or Command Prompt

### Motivation
In the industry, apps are created by teams of developers rather than individual people. Proper use of GitHub for collaboration minimizes code conflicts and helps teams work together. 

### Objectives
**Participants will be able to:**
- Create a branch within an existing GitHub repo on their laptop
- Push that branch to GitHub
- Create a pull request, merging that branch into master
- Review a peer's pull request
- Resolve simple conflicts when merging a pull request

### Specific Things To Teach
- Steps to create a new branch
- Things to check when creating a new pull request

### Supplemental Materials
- [GitHub Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/)

### Things to Remember
- If you mess up, you can usually undo what you just did. https://github.com/blog/2019-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git
- When working on a team project, NEVER push to the GitHub master branch directly. It's best to never commit directly to master as well.
- The best GitHub practices allow us to minimizes chances for merge conflicts (this happens when multiple people worked on the same file)
- When you do get a merge conflict, multiple people should sit down and resolve this either on GitHub or in Atom.
- In general, someone else should approve your pull requests to the master branch as to get an extra set of eyes. 

### Demonstration
Instructor demonstrates in the video walk through how to work with work with pull requests on GitHub

### Independent Practice  
- Create a repository on GitHub
- Clone this repo on your laptop and create new branch
- Open this folder in your favorite IDE (VS Code)
- Create a file named Readme.md, Add your name in it and save
- Commit your changes, push your changes to your branch on GitHub
- Create a PR (Pull Request) from your branch to master branch on GitHub
- Instructor modifies base branch to cause a conflict
- Resolve merge conflicts and merge their PRs

### Challenge
- Clone this repository https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum on your laptop
- Add your name to this file <curriculum/practice/students.md>
- Create a PR

### Check for Understanding
- The class should practice this project together once. After the group exercise, everyone should do the challenge individually.
- It's important to practice this project on command line as it is the standard way of interacting with GitHub in most companies.
